## Game Overview

Pong is a simple yet addictive two-player game created by [Allan Alcorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Alcorn), an engineer working at Atari, Inc. Pong was released as an arcade game in 1972, making it one of the earliest video games ever created.. The objective is straightforward: use your tennis racket to bounce the ball back and forth, competing against your opponent. The first player to miss the ball loses a point. The game continues until one player reaches the set score or until you decide it's time to stop. It's a great way to test your reflexes and have a blast with a timeless classic.
